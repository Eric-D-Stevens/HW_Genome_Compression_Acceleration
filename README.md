# Hardware Compression Acceleration of FASTQ Gene Sequence Files

As we enter the age of low cost, high accuracy next generation gene 
sequencing machines and computational biology, there will be an explosion 
of genitic data. This project seeks to implement a cost effective lossless
 compression / decompression scheme to operate on Illumina FASTQ files and be 
implemented on an FPGA for highly parallel operation.

<br />

In this repository there are two parts. The first part is the C Prototype 
of the project that can be run on any host machine. This allows for the 
development and testing of the design of the compression algorithm for its 
compression ratio and genearl functionality.

<br /> 

The second portion of this repository consists of the Verilog files that 
implement the prototype in HDL. This project was written for use with a
Xilinx development board but the files in this repository are basic verilog
that can be moved elsewhere.
